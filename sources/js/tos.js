                    Please read the following very carefully. Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Where jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.

                    All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to StreetlivesNYC remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Specifically, you agree to hold StreetlivesNYC, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers as exist now or will exist at any time in the future harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of StreetlivesNYC, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.

                    StreetlivesNYC is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers now, or at any time in the future disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. We do not guarantee that StreetlivesNYC will always work properly.

            <div className="subtitle">Limitation of liability</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use StreetlivesNYC, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.

                <li>
